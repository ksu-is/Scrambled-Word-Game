- [x] Get our project topic approved.
- [x] Establish a Github account and join the class organization.
- [x] Give ownership to Sophie so we both can see and make changes.
- [x] Create a readme.md file
- [x] Write README.md
- [x] Write projectroadmap.md
- [x] Explore python code related to our project.
- [x] Evaluate the code: We found multiple repositiories that are similar to our project idea that could help us get started in the correct direction. The thing that is different in our project versus the other ones we looked at, is that ours has three different levels to get through. I like how in the other repositories we saw is the verbage they used for the players that are playing the game. 
- [x] Finish Sprint 1.
- [x] Start building our project (start coding and using git to manage our code).
- [ ] Post updates in Github where professor can see them.
- [ ] Sophie completed 6 code changes of significant size that includes a comment that explains what was changed.
- [ ] Makenna completed 6 code changes of significant size that includes a comment that explains what was changed.
- [ ] Finish Sprint 2.
- [ ] Start refining and testing our project.
- [ ] Create one powerpoint slide introducing our topic (each person needs to submit a copy). It needs to have our team members listed, title of our project, tag line that introduces the main concept of what it does/will do, 1-2 screenshots or pictures that demonstrate our idea.
- [ ] Complete the testing QA Presentation.
- [ ] Finish Sprint 3.
- [ ] Schedule a meeting in teams (Dont overlap another project and give ourselves 30 minutes)
- [ ] During our scheduled recording, present our findings.
- [ ] End the recording and turn in our presentation by taking a screenshot of teams showing us presentating. (Each team member submits a screenshot to D2L).
